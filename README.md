# Landing Page Project

## Overview

This project is a multi-sectional page which can be navigated dynamically. When clicking on any section from header it navigates to the specifc section. The header is fixed so that the sections can be easily clicked from any part of the page.

Ii was build based on the starter project provided by Udacity, which has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I convert the starter project from a static project to an interactive one. This requires modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.


## Project Rubric
Some key rubrics include
    * All files shown must be present and the app must successfully render a home page with clear design and functionality added when index.html is loaded in the browser. No errors should display in console.
    * All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone  browsers.
    * Styling has been added for active states.
    * There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page.
    * Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.
    * It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
    * When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
